# RNA-Seq-Analysis
Sample implemented workflow of RNA-Seq Analysis used for the Arabidposis Thaliana organism

Purpose - Based on the paper "High-throughput RNA sequencing of pseudomonas-infected Arabidopsis reveals hidden transcriptome complexity 
and novel splice variants", it is unclear which genes are involved in alternative splicing of the Arabidposis R gene RPS4 that is 
important for defense against Pseudomonas. The purpose of this experiment was to identify differentially expressed genes that contribute to 
alternative splicing between the control, virulent, and avirulent forms of Arabidposis Thaliana with Pseudomonas Syringae pv tomato. 

Main Findings - From DEG Analysis, M12-A12 (mock for 12 hours â€“ avirulent for 12 hours) had 3 counts of upregulated genes and 4 counts of 
down regulated genes, which was the most differentially expressed out of any groups. This suggests that A12 could be a good candidate for 
regulated alternative splicing with possible biological relevance to the defense response.

The script details various processes of the RNA-Seq workflow which includes Read Preprocessing, Alignment, Read quantification, and Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes.
