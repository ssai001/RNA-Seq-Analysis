# RNA-Seq-Analysis
Sample implemented workflow of RNA-Seq Analysis used for the Arabidposis Thaliana organism. The script details various processes of the RNA-Seq workflow which includes Read Preprocessing, Alignment, Read quantification, and Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes. 

Purpose - Based on the paper "High-throughput RNA sequencing of pseudomonas-infected Arabidopsis reveals hidden transcriptome complexity 
and novel splice variants", it is unclear which genes are involved in alternative splicing of the Arabidposis R gene RPS4 that is 
important for defense against Pseudomonas. The purpose of this experiment was to identify differentially expressed genes that contribute to alternative splicing between the control, virulent, and avirulent forms of Arabidposis Thaliana with Pseudomonas Syringae pv tomato. 

Experimental Setup - All RNA-Seq experiments and subsequent validation experiments have been performed on four-week old soil-grown Columbia (Col-0) wild type plants, the reference genotype for Arabidopsis-related research. We carried out two independent inoculation experiments (biological replicates) for each treatment. Col-0 is susceptible to virulent Pst DC3000 but has a functional RPS4 resistance gene effective against DC3000 expressing AvrRps4 [42]. Col-0 plants were inoculated with Pst DC3000 (empty vector) and Pst DC3000 (AvrRps4) at 107 cfu/ml, and mock-inoculated with buffer only (10 mM MgCl2) to control for non-specific effects resulting from injury or tissue flooding. Challenged leaf tissues were harvested from 10 plants per sample at 1, 6, and 12 hour post-inoculation (hpi). Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen Plant RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA-USA)

Main Findings - From DEG Analysis, M12-A12 (mock for 12 hours â€“ avirulent for 12 hours) had 3 counts of upregulated genes and 4 counts of 
down regulated genes, which was the most differentially expressed out of any groups. This suggests that A12 could be a good candidate for 
regulated alternative splicing with possible biological relevance to the defense response.
